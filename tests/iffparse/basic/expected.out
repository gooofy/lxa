IFFParse library basic test
===========================

Opened iffparse.library

--- Testing GoodID/GoodType/IDtoStr ---
GoodID(FORM): TRUE (correct)
GoodID(0x00000000): FALSE (correct - contains non-printable chars)
GoodType(TEST): TRUE (correct)
GoodType(' ABC'): FALSE (correct - first char is space)
IDtoStr(ID_FORM): 'FORM'

--- Testing AllocIFF ---
AllocIFF: OK (handle allocated)
  iff_Depth: 0
  iff_Flags: 0x0

--- Testing IFF Write ---
Created T:test.iff
InitIFFasDOS completed
OpenIFF(WRITE): success
PushChunk(FORM TEST): success, depth=1
PushChunk(NAME): success, depth=2
WriteChunkBytes(NAME): wrote 13 bytes
PopChunk(NAME): success, depth=1
PushChunk(DATA): success, depth=2
WriteChunkBytes(DATA): wrote 17 bytes
PopChunk(DATA): result=0, depth=1
PopChunk(FORM): result=0, depth=0
CloseIFF: done
Closed output file

--- Testing IFF Read ---
Opened T:test.iff for reading
OpenIFF(READ): success
CurrentChunk: ID='FORM' Size=48

Parsing IFF file...
  Found chunk: ID='FORM' Type='TEST' Size=48 Scan=0
  Found chunk: ID='NAME' Type='TEST' Size=14 Scan=0
    Read 14 bytes: 'Test IFF File'
  Found chunk: ID='DATA' Type='TEST' Size=18 Scan=0
    Read 18 bytes: 'Hello, IFF World!'
ParseIFF: reached EOF (expected)
Closed IFF file
FreeIFF: done

Test completed successfully!
