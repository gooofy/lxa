Memory Stress Test
==================

Test 1: Sequential alloc/free (1000 iterations)
  Completed 1000 alloc/free cycles
  Allocation failures: 0
  Memory before: VARIES
  Memory after: VARIES
  Potential leak: 0 bytes
  PASS: Sequential alloc/free

Test 2: Batch alloc then free in order (500 blocks)
  Allocated 500 of 500 blocks
  Memory before: VARIES
  Memory after: VARIES
  Potential leak: 0 bytes
  PASS: Batch alloc/free forward

Test 3: Batch alloc then free in reverse (500 blocks)
  Allocated 500 of 500 blocks
  Memory before: VARIES
  Memory after: VARIES
  Potential leak: 0 bytes
  PASS: Batch alloc/free reverse

Test 4: Fragmentation test (alternate free pattern)
  Freed alternate blocks, then allocated VARIES large blocks
  Memory before: VARIES
  Memory after: VARIES
  Potential leak: VARIES bytes
  PASS: Fragmentation handling

Test 5: MEMF_CLEAR verification
  Tested 100 MEMF_CLEAR allocations
  Allocation failures: 0
  Clear verification failures: 0
  PASS: MEMF_CLEAR verification

Test 6: Mixed size allocations
  Allocated 500 blocks of mixed sizes
  Memory before: VARIES
  Memory after: VARIES
  Potential leak: 0 bytes
  PASS: Mixed size allocations
