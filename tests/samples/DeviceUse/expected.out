DeviceUse: Demonstrating basic device I/O

DeviceUse: Created message port at 0x
DeviceUse: Created IORequest at 0x
DeviceUse: Opening timer.device (UNIT_VBLANK)...
DeviceUse: timer.device opened successfully
  Device: 0x
  Unit:   0x

=== Synchronous I/O Example (DoIO) ===
Waiting 2 seconds using DoIO...
  Starting DoIO (blocks until complete)...
  DoIO completed! Error = 0

=== Asynchronous I/O Example (SendIO/WaitIO) ===
Performing 3 async timer requests...
  [1] Sending async request (SendIO)...
  [1] Request sent, doing other work...
  [1] Waiting for completion (WaitIO)...
  [1] Request completed! Error = 0
  [2] Sending async request (SendIO)...
  [2] Request sent, doing other work...
  [2] Waiting for completion (WaitIO)...
  [2] Request completed! Error = 0
  [3] Sending async request (SendIO)...
  [3] Request sent, doing other work...
  [3] Waiting for completion (WaitIO)...
  [3] Request completed! Error = 0

=== CheckIO Example ===
Sending async request and polling with CheckIO...
  Sending async request...
  Request completed after checks!

=== AbortIO Example ===
Sending request and immediately aborting it...
  Sending 10-second request...
  Aborting request...
  Waiting for abort to complete...
  Request aborted! Error = -2
  (IOERR_ABORTED = request was successfully aborted)

=== Cleanup ===
  Closing timer.device...
  Deleting IORequest...
  Deleting message port...

DeviceUse: Device I/O demonstration complete.
