Allocate: Demonstrating Exec memory allocation

=== AllocMem Example ===
Allocating 1024 bytes with MEMF_PUBLIC | MEMF_CLEAR...
  Allocated at: 0x
  Checking if memory is cleared...
  OK: All 1024 bytes are zero
  Writing test pattern...
  Wrote pattern to memory
  Available memory (MEMF_PUBLIC): 10309120 bytes
  Available memory (MEMF_CHIP): 10309120 bytes
  Available memory (MEMF_FAST): 0 bytes

=== AllocVec Example ===
Allocating 2048 bytes with MEMF_PUBLIC | MEMF_CLEAR...
  Allocated at: 0x
  (AllocVec stores size internally, so FreeVec doesn't need size)

=== AllocEntry Example ===
Allocating multiple memory blocks in one call...
  AllocEntry succeeded!
  Allocated 3 blocks:
    Block 1: 512 bytes at 0x
    Block 2: 1024 bytes at 0x
    Block 3: 256 bytes at 0x

=== TypeOfMem Example ===
Checking memory types...
  mem1 (AllocMem): 0x PUBLIC CHIP 
  mem3 (AllocVec): 0x PUBLIC CHIP 

=== Cleanup ===
Freeing all allocated memory...
  Freeing mem1 (AllocMem)...
  Freeing mem3 (AllocVec)...
  Freeing memlist (FreeEntry)...
