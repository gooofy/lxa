SimpleTimer: Demonstrating timer.device

SimpleTimer: Test 1 - Creating timer (UNIT_VBLANK)...
  TimerRequest created: 0x
  Device: 0x
  Unit: 0x
  Timer deleted successfully

SimpleTimer: Test 2 - Creating timer (UNIT_MICROHZ)...
  TimerRequest created: 0x
  TimerBase set to: 0x
  Timer deleted successfully

SimpleTimer: Test 3 - Getting system time (TR_GETSYSTIME)...
  System time retrieved successfully
  Seconds: TIME, Microseconds: TIME
  Time: HH:MM:SS (Days: N)

SimpleTimer: Test 4 - Multiple TR_GETSYSTIME calls...
  (Microseconds should increase between calls)
  First:  TIME.MICRO
  Second: TIME.MICRO
  Third:  TIME.MICRO
  Time correctly increased by N microseconds

SimpleTimer: Test 5 - Short delay (50ms using UNIT_MICROHZ)...
  Before delay: TIME.MICRO
  After delay:  TIME.MICRO
  Actual delay: N microseconds (requested 50000)
  Delay completed successfully

SimpleTimer: Test 6 - Short delay (using UNIT_VBLANK)...
  Before delay: TIME.MICRO
  After delay:  TIME.MICRO
  Actual delay: N microseconds
  Delay completed successfully

SimpleTimer: Demo complete.
