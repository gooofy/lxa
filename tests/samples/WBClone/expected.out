WBClone: Locking Workbench screen...
WBClone: Workbench screen locked at 0x
WBClone: Screen dimensions: 640x256x2
WBClone: Screen ModeID: 0x

WBClone: Locking IntuitionBase...
WBClone: IntuitionBase locked (lock=0x)
WBClone: ViewLord at 0x
WBClone: ViewLord.Modes: 0x0000
WBClone: ViewLord.DxOffset: 0, DyOffset: 0
WBClone: IntuitionBase unlocked

WBClone: Reading Workbench ColorMap...
WBClone: No ColorMap found

WBClone: Creating matching BitMap...
WBClone: Allocating BitMap (640x256x2)...
WBClone: BitMap initialized at 0x
WBClone: BytesPerRow=80, Rows=256, Depth=2
WBClone: Plane 0 allocated at 0x
WBClone: Plane 1 allocated at 0x

WBClone: Creating RastPort for rendering...
WBClone: RastPort initialized at 0x
WBClone: Clearing bitmap with SetRast(0)...
WBClone: BitMap cleared
WBClone: Drawing border pattern...
WBClone: Border drawn with pen 3
WBClone: Diagonal lines drawn

WBClone: Rendering complete (bitmap not displayed on screen)
WBClone: In a full implementation, MakeVPort/MrgCop/LoadView would display this.

WBClone: Cleaning up...
WBClone: RastPort freed
WBClone: Plane 0 freed
WBClone: Plane 1 freed
WBClone: BitMap freed
WBClone: Workbench screen unlocked
WBClone: Libraries closed

WBClone: Demo complete.
