=== Test: Integer to FFP (SPFlt) ===
  SPFlt(10) -> SPFix = 10 (expected: 10)
  SPFlt(3) -> SPFix = 3 (expected: 3)
  SPFlt(42) -> SPFix = 42 (expected: 42)
  SPFlt(-25) -> SPFix = -25 (expected: -25)
  PASS: Integer-FFP conversion roundtrip works

=== Test: FFP Addition (SPAdd) ===
  SPAdd(10, 3) = 13 (expected: 13)
  SPAdd(-5, 8) = 3 (expected: 3)
  PASS: Addition works correctly

=== Test: FFP Subtraction (SPSub) ===
  SPSub(10, 3) = 7 (expected: 7)
  SPSub(5, 12) = -7 (expected: -7)
  PASS: Subtraction works correctly

=== Test: FFP Multiplication (SPMul) ===
  SPMul(10, 3) = 30 (expected: 30)
  SPMul(-4, 7) = -28 (expected: -28)
  PASS: Multiplication works correctly

=== Test: FFP Division (SPDiv) ===
  SPDiv(30, 5) = 6 (expected: 6)
  SPDiv(100, 4) = 25 (expected: 25)
  PASS: Division works correctly

=== Test: FFP Comparison (SPCmp) ===
  SPCmp(10, 3) = 1 (expected: positive)
  SPCmp(3, 10) = -1 (expected: negative)
  SPCmp(7, 7) = 0 (expected: 0)
  PASS: Comparison works correctly

=== Test: FFP Negation (SPNeg) ===
  SPNeg(42) = -42 (expected: -42)
  SPNeg(-17) = 17 (expected: 17)
  PASS: Negation works correctly

=== Test: FFP Absolute Value (SPAbs) ===
  SPAbs(-42) = 42 (expected: 42)
  SPAbs(17) = 17 (expected: 17)
  PASS: Absolute value works correctly

=== Test: FFP Test (SPTst) ===
  SPTst(0) = 0 (expected: 0)
  SPTst(42) = 1 (expected: positive)
  SPTst(-17) = -1 (expected: negative)
  PASS: Test works correctly

=== Test: Zero Handling ===
  0 + 1 = 1 (expected: 1)
  0 * 1 = 0 (expected: 0)
  SPCmp(0, 0) = 0 (expected: 0)
  PASS: Zero handling works correctly
