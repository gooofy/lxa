TimerSoftInt: Demonstrating software interrupts with Cause()

TimerSoftInt: Created software interrupt structure
  Node Type: 2 (should be 2 for NT_INTERRUPT)
  Priority: 0
  Name: TimerSoftInt

=== Testing Cause() ===
Cause() triggers a software interrupt immediately.
We'll call it 5 times and watch the counter increment.

[1] Before Cause(): interrupt_count = 0
[1] After Cause():  interrupt_count = 1

[2] Before Cause(): interrupt_count = 1
[2] After Cause():  interrupt_count = 2

[3] Before Cause(): interrupt_count = 2
[3] After Cause():  interrupt_count = 3

[4] Before Cause(): interrupt_count = 3
[4] After Cause():  interrupt_count = 4

[5] Before Cause(): interrupt_count = 4
[5] After Cause():  interrupt_count = 5

=== Test Complete ===
Total interrupts triggered: 5 (expected 5)
SUCCESS: All interrupt handlers executed correctly!

=== Cleanup ===
Freeing interrupt structure...

TimerSoftInt: Software interrupt demonstration complete.
