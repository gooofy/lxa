=== Testing Software Interrupts ===
Sending 5 async timer requests with interrupt callback...

[1] Sending async request (
[1] Waiting for completion...
[1] Request completed. Interrupt count = 1

[2] Sending async request (
[2] Waiting for completion...
[2] Request completed. Interrupt count = 2

[3] Sending async request (
[3] Waiting for completion...
[3] Request completed. Interrupt count = 3

[4] Sending async request (
[4] Waiting for completion...
[4] Request completed. Interrupt count = 4

[5] Sending async request (
[5] Waiting for completion...
[5] Request completed. Interrupt count = 5

=== Test Complete ===
Total interrupts triggered: 5

=== Demonstrating Cause() ===
Cause() triggers a software interrupt immediately...
Current interrupt count: 5
Calling Cause() directly...
New interrupt count:

=== Cleanup ===
Closing timer.device...
Freeing interrupt structure...
Deleting IORequest...
Deleting message port...
