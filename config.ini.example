# RAM size in bytes (default: 10 MB)

[drives]
# Map Amiga logical drives to Linux directories
# Drive names are case-insensitive
# Paths support tilde (~) expansion

# System drive - typically contains AmigaOS system files
SYS = ~/.lxa/drive_hd0

# Work drive - for your projects
Work = ~/amiga_work

# Additional hard drives
DH1 = ~/amiga_projects
DH2 = /mnt/data/amiga

[floppies]
# Map floppy drives to directories
# Like drives, these are just directories on Linux
DF0 = ~/.lxa/floppy0
DF1 = ~/.lxa/floppy1

# Example: map to a directory containing game files
# DF0 = ~/Downloads/amiga_game

# Note: ADF (Amiga Disk File) support is not yet implemented
# For now, floppies are simply directories like hard drives
