# lxa Configuration File
# 
# This file configures the lxa AmigaOS-compatible environment.
# Place this file in your LXA_PREFIX directory (default: ~/.lxa).
#
# Syntax:
#   - Comments start with # or ;
#   - Sections are in [brackets]
#   - Key = Value pairs configure settings

[system]
# ROM image path
# If not specified, lxa will search for lxa.rom in:
#   - Current directory
#   - src/rom/ (relative to current directory)
#   - LXA_PREFIX directory
#   - /usr/share/lxa/
#   - /usr/local/share/lxa/
# rom_path = /usr/share/lxa/lxa.rom

# RAM size in bytes (default: 10MB)
# ram_size = 10485760

[drives]
# Map Amiga logical drives to Linux directories
# Drive names should be uppercase (e.g., SYS, DH0, DF0)

# System drive - contains C:, S:, Libs:, Devs:, etc.
# If not specified, defaults to the 'sys/' subdirectory or current directory
# SYS = ~/.lxa/System

# Hard disk drives
# DH0 = ~/amiga/disks/dh0
# DH1 = ~/amiga/disks/dh1

# Floppy drives (directory-based)
# DF0 = ~/.lxa/floppies/df0
# DF1 = ~/.lxa/floppies/df1

[floppies]
# Alternative section for floppy drive mapping
# DF0 = /path/to/floppy0
# DF1 = /path/to/floppy1

[assigns]
# Assign logical names to directories
# These are resolved like AmigaDOS assigns
# LIBS = SYS:Libs
# DEVS = SYS:Devs
