# lxa Roadmap: Towards a Fuller AmigaOS Implementation

This document outlines the strategic plan for expanding `lxa` into a more complete AmigaOS-compatible environment, focusing on **Exec**, **DOS**, and a functional **Userland**. We follow a "WINE-like" approach for DOS, where filesystem operations are efficiently bridged to the host Linux system.

**IMPORTANT**: **Always** adhere to project and coding standards outlined in `AGENTS.md` ! Test coverage, roadmap updates and documentations are **mandatory** in this project!

---

## Core Philosophy & Boundaries

### WINE-like DOS Approach
Instead of emulating hardware-level disk controllers and running Amiga-native filesystems (like OFS/FFS) on top, `lxa` maps Amiga logical drives directly to Linux directories.

- **Drives as Directories**: `DH0:`, `DF0:`, etc., are backed by standard Linux directories.
- **Host Interception**: DOS calls (`Open`, `Read`, `Lock`, etc.) are handled by the host `lxa` process using Linux system calls.
- **Auto-Provisioning**: On first run, `lxa` creates a default `~/.lxa` structure with `SYS:`, `S:`, `C:`, etc., and populates them with a basic `Startup-Sequence` and essential tools.

### Support Boundaries

| Feature | Status/Goal | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exec Multitasking** | Full Support | Signal-based multitasking, Message Ports, Semaphores. |
| **DOS Filesystem** | Hosted | Mapped to Linux via VFS layer. |
| **Interactive Shell** | Full Support | Amiga-compatible Shell with prompt, history, and scripting. |
| **Assigns** | Full Support | Logical assigns, multi-directory assigns (Paths). |
| **Floppy Emulation** | Directory-based | Floppies appear as directories. |

## Active Phases

## Phase 22: Console Device Completion & KP2 Compatibility (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Fix console.device to match real Amiga behavior, enable full KickPascal 2 functionality.

### Step 22.1: Console Device Line Mode Fix (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Created kp2_test** - Mimics KP2's 1-byte-at-a-time read pattern
- [x] **Fixed lxa_dev_console.c** - Only wait if no complete line in buffer
- [x] **Verified fix** - kp2_test passes, reads buffered characters immediately

### Step 22.2: Additional Console Device Features (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] **CON: Handler vs console.device** - May need CON: handler layer for some apps
- [ ] **Raw Mode** - Character-at-a-time input mode (ACTION_SCREEN_MODE)
- [ ] **Input Buffer Semantics** - Exact handling of backspace/delete in edge cases

### Step 22.3: KickPascal 2 Validation (NEEDS MANUAL TESTING)
- [x] **Automated unit test** - kp2_test validates the fix works
- [ ] **Manual KP2 test** - Launch real KP2, test workspace input interactively
- [ ] **Basic Editing Test** - Open editor, type text, verify display
- [ ] **Reference Screenshots** - Compare against real Amiga captures

**Note**: Full KP2 validation requires manual testing since we can't inject keys into SDL windows programmatically without xdotool or similar tools.

### Step 23.3: Window Layer Clipping (from Phase 20.3)
- [ ] **Bounds Checking** - Implement pixel-level clipping in WritePixel, Draw, Text, etc.
- [ ] **Layer ClipRect Usage** - Use layer's ClipRect list for proper clipping (already built by layers.library)
- [ ] **Test** - Verify out-of-bounds drawing is properly clipped

### Step 26.3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile critical paths, optimize VFS, memory allocation, emucall overhead.

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Shell Features Not Implemented
- I/O redirection (>, >>, <) - commands use internal TO/FROM arguments
- Pipe support (`cmd1 | cmd2`)
- Variable substitution in commands
- SKIP/LAB (goto labels), WHILE loops

### DOS Functions Stubbed
- GetDeviceProc/FreeDeviceProc - handler-based architecture not implemented
- MakeLink - filesystem links not supported

### Notes
- Stack size hardcoded to 4096 in SystemTagList (NP_StackSize tag supported)
- Environment variable inheritance not implemented for child processes
- DosList functions simplified - assigns enumerated via host VFS

## Implementation Rules
1. **Clean Room Approach**: AROS/Kickstart source is for architectural reference ONLY.
2. **Host-First**: Prefer host-side (`emucall`) implementations for filesystem tasks.
3. **Amiga Authenticity**: Commands must use AmigaDOS argument syntax (templates, keywords, switches).
4. **Tooling**: Use `ReadArgs()` template parsing in all `C:` commands.
5. **Test Everything**: Every function, every command, every edge case. 100% coverage is mandatory.
